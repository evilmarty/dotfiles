# Marty's Dot Files

Contained is the epitome of evil, a collection of files and configurations, that make up my Bash environment. Use it if you dare.

__Note__ use at your own risk.

## Installation

Run the following commands to get started becoming evil. Any files that already exist will prompt you to overwrite.

```
git clone git://github.com/evilmarty/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
sh install.sh
```

## Todo

I need to reorganise my Vim setup as it's no longer my primary editor and should recommission it for remote editing and terminal modifications where a gui editor cannot be used.
